- Implement during game setup phase
- Store this information in the player object
- Use age for difficulty scaling

## 3. Age-Based Difficulty Scaling
- Implement a sliding scale of question difficulty based on user age
- Younger players receive simpler questions
- Older players receive more challenging questions
- Create difficulty tiers based on age ranges
- Maintain manual difficulty selection as an override option

## 4. New Question Categories
